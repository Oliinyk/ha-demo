                <p>We want to make sure the Website is a safe place for us and our users. For this reason, we need to have certain rules about the use of the Website, including certain conduct that is prohibited. You agree not to use the Website in any way or engage in any conduct that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. is unlawful, illegal, or unauthorized;</li>
                    <li>2. is likely to disrupt our service in any way; or</li>

                    <li>4. advocates, promotes or assists any violence or any unlawful act.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We reserve the right at our sole discretion to terminate any user’s access to Website if they violate this Section 5 or any other provision of these Terms.</p>
                <h6>6. H&amp;A IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIRD-PARTY CONTENT</h6>
                <p>The Website may contain links to third-party web sites, products, and services (each, a “Linked Third-Party Service”). H&amp;A is not responsible for the content of Linked Third-Party Services and does not make any representations or warranties regarding the content or accuracy of any such content. When you access and use a Linked Third-Party Service, you are subject to that third party’s terms and conditions of use and privacy policy and you agree that H&amp;A is not responsible for and has made no representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding any Linked Third-Party Service and that H&amp;A shall have no liability relating to such Linked Third-Party Service except to the extent such liability is caused by the negligence of H&amp;A. Your use of any Linked Third-Party Service is at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such offerings.</p>
                <h6>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h6>
                <p>We provide the Website on an ‘as is’ and ‘as available’ basis without any promises or representations, expressed or implied. For example, we make no promises about how the Website will work, that they will be error-free, uninterrupted or have no defects. The law also provides certain implied warranties, such as warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular use; we disclaim those warranties, meaning they do not apply to the Website.</p>
                <h6>8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h6>
                <p>THIS SECTION LIMITS THE DAMAGE YOU CAN RECOVER FROM US. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY OF ANY KIND, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, OR LOSS OF DATA) OR LIABILITIES UNDER ANY CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER THEORY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY MANNER TO THE WEBSITE, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES. YOUR SOLE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO THE WEBSITE IS TO STOP USING THE WEBSITE.</p>
                <p>SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES AND/OR LIABILITIES, SO CERTAIN OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
                <h6>9. TERMINATION</h6>
                <p>These Terms are effective unless and until terminated by either you or H&amp;A. You may terminate these Terms at any time, provided that you discontinue any further use of the Website. We also may terminate or suspend these Terms, at any time, without notice and accordingly deny you access to the Website, for any reason, including without limitation, if at our sole discretion you fail to comply with any provision of these Terms or your use is harmful to the interests of another user of the Website. Upon any termination of the Terms by either you or us, you must promptly cease using the Website.</p>
                <p>Termination will not limit any of our other rights and remedies. Any provision that must survive in order to give proper effect to the intent and purpose of these Terms shall survive termination.</p>
                <h6>10. MANAGING DISPUTES</h6>
                <p>There are limitations to how you can resolve disputes with us, and it is important that you understand them. You only have one year to file any claim against us related to the Website provided and you agree that you will only bring a claim against us on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member as part of a class or representative action or proceeding.</p>
                <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU MAY SEEK RELIEF FROM US. LIMITATION ON TIME TO BRING AN ACTION</p>
                <p>You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Website brought by you must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or such claim or cause of action will be forever barred.

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
